⚡️ Web Enthusiast ⚡️

I’m a self-taught Fullstack Engineer with 8+ years of experience, specializing in building high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. While my core strength lies in front-end development, I also bring solid fullstack expertise that allows me to design, build, and optimize complete solutions from front to back.

My primary focus is on front-end architecture and user experience, with deep proficiency in React, Next.js, Node.js, and the modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem. I’ve led initiatives around performance optimization, accessibility, and design systems—ensuring applications are not only fast and reliable but also consistent and inclusive for all users.

Beyond technical implementation, I contribute to shaping engineering culture: mentoring teammates, conducting technical interviews, and supporting onboarding processes. I’ve also worked on knowledge-sharing initiatives, proof of concepts, and cross-functional collaboration that drive innovation and long-term scalability.

Passionate about both craft and community, I regularly share knowledge through tech talks, meetups, and collaborative workshops. My goal is to continue bridging the gap between technical excellence and user-centric design—delivering applications that balance performance, accessibility, and maintainability.
